# Subjects Review

This was a capstone project for COMP30022 created over a 12-week period

Subjects Review is a personal item registry tool that provides a platform not only for storage of University of Melbourne subject experiences and reviews, but for the sharing of them with other University of Melbourne students.

## The Project

This project develops a forensic tool to detect and analyse deepfake and synthetic media. The system supports both images and videos, providing automated preprocessing, anomaly detection, and metadata inspection. Results are presented with clear visualisations such as heatmaps and frame comparisons, along with detailed forensic reports. Designed for investigators and analysts, the tool offers a simple web interface, offline usability, and extensible architecture to support future integration of new models and methods.
