# Deepfake Detection System

A comprehensive forensic tool for detecting and analyzing deepfake and synthetic media using state-of-the-art AI models.

## The Project

This project develops a forensic tool to detect and analyse deepfake and synthetic media. The system supports both images and videos, providing automated preprocessing, anomaly detection, and metadata inspection. Results are presented with clear visualisations such as heatmaps and frame comparisons, along with detailed forensic reports. Designed for investigators and analysts, the tool offers a simple web interface, offline usability, and extensible architecture to support future integration of new models and methods.

### Key Features

- **TruFor Integration**: Advanced forensic framework with pixel-level localization
- **Dual Model Support**: Both ResNet50 and TruFor models available
- **Real-time Analysis**: Fast processing with confidence-weighted pooling
- **Interactive UI**: Modern web interface with drag-and-drop support
- **Offline Operation**: Complete local processing without internet dependency

## Quick Start

1. Install dependencies:
```powershell
python -m venv .venv
pip install -r requirements.txt
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

2. **Download model files** (Required):
```bash
# Automatic download (recommended)
python models\download_models.py

# Or get from team members (see MODEL_SETUP.md)
```

3. Test your model:
```bash
python scripts\test_model.py
```

4. Start server with TruFor model (recommended):
```bash
python scripts\start_trufor.py
```

Or start with ResNet50 model:
```bash
python scripts\start_local_model.py
```

### üìÅ Model Files Required
- `trufor.pth.tar` (~500MB) - Primary TruFor model
- `deepfake_resnet50.pth` (~100MB) - ResNet50 alternative
- `deepfake_resnet18.pth` (~50MB) - ResNet18 lightweight

See [MODEL_SETUP.md](MODEL_SETUP.md) for detailed setup instructions and [TRUFOR_TECHNICAL_GUIDE.md](TRUFOR_TECHNICAL_GUIDE.md) for technical implementation details.

### UI Development

For updating UI, remember to run:
```bash
npm run build
``` 
to compile the latest `app-compiled.css`
