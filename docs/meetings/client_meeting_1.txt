2025-08-14 20:00:58
As long as the licence allows you to do that. OK, cool. And also for the a final report like is there any like required like reference there, for example, like APA or Chicago or no, we don't reference like that. Like actually I think the software is not as complicated as.

2025-08-14 20:01:03
The reference in the papers, Yep.

2025-08-14 20:01:05
Thank you.

2025-08-14 20:03:48
For this meeting, I think it's first. Maybe we can start with addressing some of the questions like.

2025-08-14 20:03:53
And.

2025-08-14 20:03:57
Yeah.

2025-08-14 20:04:00
Sorry, can you hear me?

2025-08-14 20:04:04
Yeah, a little bit quiet, but go ahead.

2025-08-14 20:04:07
Yeah, I just had a.

2025-08-14 20:04:18
Few questions on behalf of my team as well. Just to confirm the file size, is there no set file limit?

2025-08-14 20:04:22
So it's just as much as we have to process, yeah.

2025-08-14 20:04:29
And in terms of just the UI layout of the actual tool, were you looking for?

2025-08-14 20:04:33
A web app or an actual separate?

2025-08-14 20:04:44
Apple or an API that can be integrated somehow into some sort of software you guys already have. It's just aware that would be fine. Just a web interface, yeah.

2025-08-14 20:04:52
And the actual UI itself. I'm assuming we're catering to people who are non technical. That's right.

2025-08-14 20:05:06
Certainly not. There might be technical in regard to understanding that the data and systems that the data comes from, but definitely not with regard to development or application development.

2025-08-14 20:05:08
That makes sense.

2025-08-14 20:05:31
Sorry, I should say, but it would be also useful for someone who really can just click and point. So they have the tool that they upload some files and they want to see the results. So both ends of the spectrum, maybe people who understand how the files were created or the that the media was created, but also users with limited understanding. So yeah.

2025-08-14 20:05:43
And I guess just for now, a quick final question is in terms of the report and the actual analysis report that we're going to be providing the.

2025-08-14 20:06:09
Investigator, once they provide the media and we get them the results, what sort of information do we have to include in the report or can we expect to include? Yeah, well, it's depending on. So let's say I have an image and it's and it's actually been falsified or I guess it's been edited. It may be, you know, manipulated in some way or it could have been generated by fully generated by some AI tool.

2025-08-14 20:06:17
Whatever your analysis identified, let's say it's areas of the. Let's just use images as an example.

2025-08-14 20:06:34
Areas of the image that you believe are manipulated, so marking marking with some sort of heat map or orientation around what parts of the image may have been manipulated. Depending on the analysis findings you can present that.

2025-08-14 20:07:03
But I think someone asked in the call the other day, is information about the file important? So the meta data. So I guess the first thing would be what do we know about the source image? When was it image or video? When was it created? What's its file name? What's some of the embedded characteristics? Does it, does it have the X if data embedded in it that tells us the source device that created the image, the GPS locations.

2025-08-14 20:07:13
It really depends on what your analytical engine detects from the source material. I mean, hopefully the analytical engine can detect lots of things.

2025-08-14 20:07:18
That maybe each media type you process does not have all of those things or those attributes.

2025-08-14 20:07:26
So it's a matter of justice presenting what do we have, what have we found and some form of.

2025-08-14 20:07:31
Humanly understandable sort of summary. Perhaps it's.

2025-08-14 20:07:43
Know we've identified the highlighted areas to potentially be manipulated or we believe that the images are totally AI generated.

2025-08-14 20:07:45
That we can, perhaps.

2025-08-14 20:07:55
As you're exploring what you might better present, you can ask me some questions during the project to help you refine what you present and.

2025-08-14 20:08:01
But think think of think of a user saying I want to know as this image been.

2025-08-14 20:08:04
Completely generated or does it have?

2025-08-14 20:08:14
Elements of modification and those findings they may want to present in some legal forum that would expect it to be reliable.

2025-08-14 20:08:18
So however you can present material to reinforce.

2025-08-14 20:08:22
Why it's reliable? Observations or findings?

2025-08-14 20:08:29
I think after you practise a few and you try to, you might get a sense of what's good to tell a user.

2025-08-14 20:08:59
Yeah, and just to follow up with that, in terms of providing something that a human could understand results, I'm assuming visualisations are gonna be a big thing for MP4 files like videos. What sort of visualisations 'cause obviously images, heat maps would be good. Yep, like for videos, what could we expect to have to do? Well, I think some things have been done traditionally in analysis of video is taking.

2025-08-14 20:09:04
Shot of the area of the video that's of interest so if you.

2025-08-14 20:09:19
Analyse it, hopefully short video. You might find some frames or some sections of the video that your analysis algorithm has identified, so reporting the location in the video, so the time.

2025-08-14 20:09:49
The time points where there's interesting things that have been identified, perhaps taking a snapshot or a frame capture, several frames, one frame, whatever thinks appropriate so that the person can go, oh wow, it's a, you know, it's a 5 minute video or a 3 minute video. But at this particular point, I think there's something really interesting at this point. He's a frame of what we found. And yeah, look, it does, it does look like the face is different from the face in the 1st frame. So maybe comparing some frames.

2025-08-14 20:09:51
Saying these frames are different as anomalies.

2025-08-14 20:09:54
So you could probably treat.

2025-08-14 20:09:58
The output of video analysis like the image analysis.

2025-08-14 20:10:06
So you could do heat maps, you could do as I said, frame compares you.

2025-08-14 20:10:07
And textually.

2025-08-14 20:10:10
Explain to the user what's been found.

2025-08-14 20:10:39
And think about what the person will do after they run the tool. They say, well that's helpful. These tools analysed a 3 minute video and it's found that there was a video of a person trying to break into the car. And that time, you know, 2 minutes and three seconds, the window is smashed and you capture A-frame and you just show that in your results. And the fridge gamers will go, well, that's really what I want. I'm going to go and watch the video.

2025-08-14 20:10:47
So this tool would be used where there might be perhaps there's 20 or 30 or 40.

2025-08-14 20:10:50
CCTV short.

2025-08-14 20:11:17
Videos that are being captured from a camera, and the user will use the tool to save the time of watching every video from start to finish, having to rewind start to finish. So you're trying to make their job easier and actually give them confidence it's worth going back to the original video. Does that make sense? Yeah, that does make sense. And you might be creative and come up with some other ways to present your findings. So please.

2025-08-14 20:11:21
Don't rely on what I'm suggesting, but that will be a start.

2025-08-14 20:11:25
I have a follow up question with that scenario.

2025-08-14 20:11:56
For example, where let's say you have a one hour footage of a CCTV and the occursion occurred that someone broke in the you're suggesting that for us to find basically cut out to that 5 minutes whether breaking happened and for us to analyse that part. Is it also possible for us to determine that the whole one hour video could have imperfections where the AI can actually catch it, being a fully synthetic?

2025-08-14 20:12:05
I just what are you saying that the one hour could be synthetic fully?

2025-08-14 20:12:14
AI generated one hour video, is that what you're saying? Yeah, we've run with a heavy version of AK Sampler, yes.

2025-08-14 20:12:39
I mean, I guess it was, it's possible for something to be anything to generate. I mean we all know that you can make movies from some AI tools, but I think it's probably unlikely in the real world that there would be a one hour CCTV video that's synthetically generated. I acknowledge of course it could be possible, but think of the more real world scenario where think of it's a warehouse and they have.

2025-08-14 20:12:53
They have video surveillance and it's on motion detection. And so someone breaks in, they're walking around the warehouse trying to steal things or whatever they're there to do. There will be motion detection captures of 20 seconds, 60 seconds.

2025-08-14 20:12:56
3 minutes.

2025-08-14 20:13:03
That's the more realistic scenario, but of course there could be a video CCTV system that runs.

2025-08-14 20:13:09
24/7 and it has looping looping video for every day or however I've set it up.

2025-08-14 20:13:13
So what would happen in a forensic investigation cases?

2025-08-14 20:13:33
It would be unlikely that an investigator would get 24 hours with a video and sit there watching it. You know, if you use old school practises right? Where you can only watch using the CCTV replay method, or you export it and you play it in a video player, it's more likely that.

2025-08-14 20:13:49
And I've done this myself over over many years, way back to when videos were on VHS tapes. Your investigation identifies that something probably happened between this window of 10 minutes, half an hour, you know, not 24 hours, roughly.

2025-08-14 20:13:54
What might have happened? So you export that 10 minutes of video and you have a look at that.

2025-08-14 20:14:06
Does it make sense? So the real world is probably not an hour long video or a three hour long video. It's extracted pieces that we will run through this tool.

2025-08-14 20:14:26
Because it's probably unrealistic. Your tool could process 2345 hours of video. But if you can do that, please do that. If you are able to create a tool that could process the two hour video and pull out things, I would love to see that. Yeah, I'm trying to make the scenario.

2025-08-14 20:14:54
Simple for you, but go your hardest to make it sophisticated. Yep. So the question basically was trying to answer if because when generating some parts where there's nothing going on, AI will decide to create hallucinations. Even though nothing has happened. It's a still frame. If a human were to do it, they would just loop the video where an AI they might be like, oh, they're no one's walking through here. OK, let's just add someone walking through and there could be a problem there.

2025-08-14 20:15:20
So that's why the I asked, had asked that question. And what's the tool it's adding? What's the tool that's adding the person? So AI the tool you create. Yeah. So let's say right now I would have generate A720P video of a CCTV footage for an hour. With current standards, it's actually quite able to do a decent job of concert footage.

2025-08-14 20:15:24
To back up the claim to let's say an accident had occurred.

2025-08-14 20:15:52
That whole hour could have generated with AK sampler to make sure everything is running coherently. But that is being said that AI might add in hallucinations where a person might come in and frame just disappear and being corrected. Well, I mean, from my perspective as a forensic investigator, I mean, I want to know what's there, what's not there, what's, you know, frame transitions that are weird, I mean.

2025-08-14 20:16:01
Develop the tool to tell me that and then the human will look at the a bit. Like I sort of said to the other question, the human will review this, the tool is not.

2025-08-14 20:16:09
The purpose at all is not to find it and be the decision maker, It's to find things worthy of further human assessment.

2025-08-14 20:16:29
All right, yeah, I've also got another question with the data set. So I'm where my group is deciding to target media for us still media and then focusing to transition onto video. So having it all built into one with.

2025-08-14 20:16:44
The data set we want to train on, if it is, do you want us to supply it ourselves? Because we still haven't received anything on the directive to find. What is the kind of data you want us to look at now? If you just I think we said the other day is.

2025-08-14 20:16:51
There's plenty of deep fake research sites with original source and modified source.

2025-08-14 20:17:03
Examples that you'll be able to find public available open source test test data. So I encourage you to go and look for those video maybe harder.

2025-08-14 20:17:05
So.

2025-08-14 20:17:11
Just try and do some of your own research to find test data.

2025-08-14 20:17:17
My question back to you about you said you want to transition from image analysis seamlessly to video.

2025-08-14 20:17:24
And I'm not a video analytics expert and I know a little bit about it, but I would have thought different algorithms.

2025-08-14 20:17:31
Would be required to do some of the clever video analytics that is not relevant to images, is it?

2025-08-14 20:17:39
Whilst that is correct, from my personal experience with generating AI is that.

2025-08-14 20:18:03
When detecting video, it is detected from frame to frame, the transition and making sure it's coherent. That being said, each individual frame that is worth being run on. So let's say it's an hour, we split it down to that 5 minutes. We'll run each individual frame of that through the media version of our module.

2025-08-14 20:18:16
Basically checking if that has any AI generated parts towards it along with. Thank you here your logic, that makes sense to me.

2025-08-14 20:18:17
The.

2025-08-14 20:18:24
Are you particularly thinking about AI generated? So bear in mind that.

2025-08-14 20:18:35
The tool would be very valuable to have the capability to analyse things that are not AI generated. They're real images that have been edited.

2025-08-14 20:18:44
Definitely, so there will be some analytics. It's got nothing to do with AI so but feel free to dig and explore and.

2025-08-14 20:18:49
And present a tool that can do a range of things.

2025-08-14 20:19:10
So actually on that, I just thought of something, if something, let's say if a piece of image or video were to be edited but not AI edited, so traditional forms of editing, would we still want us? Do you still want us to flag that? Absolutely, absolutely. So any.

2025-08-14 20:19:34
So in the notes that we circulated, you're looking for noise, noise features in the media, looking at as you sort of talked quite a bit about frame to frame changes, looking at feature feature analysis where maybe the two ears don't look the same or someone's cut and paste some different eyes in there. So we're definitely not talking about.

2025-08-14 20:19:37
We're not only talking about synthetic media.

2025-08-14 20:19:39
It could be manually edited.

2025-08-14 20:19:59
Thought I should just think of a scenario where there's a court case, someone's there's been some sort of, there's some sort of legal dispute or fight and someone wants to present a photo to prove that something took place or to prove that they were there and they've taken a real photo and they've actually put themselves into it or they've taken someone out of it.

2025-08-14 20:20:03
If you do it in your mobile phone now, can't you take a photo and take your friend out?

2025-08-14 20:20:09
You have to stand around and no one, no one even knows your friend was with you when the photo was taken, standing right next to you.

2025-08-14 20:20:15
So even that sort of stuff is really, really useful in that.

2025-08-14 20:20:20
Evidence to make them untruthful.

2025-08-14 20:20:30
And it's not the deep fakes are sexy tumour. You know, it's really a hot topic, but it's not just about that deep fake where someone.

2025-08-14 20:20:46
Create your video of Barack Obama saying something or some movie star saying something. We're talking about real world photos where there's people disputing something and someone saying this is true. This video, this photo is true and it's actually not.

2025-08-14 20:20:49
How do we how do we prove that?

2025-08-14 20:20:57
How do we do some automated analysis to identify where the errors changes, editing, falsification is?

2025-08-14 20:21:07
Does that sort of make sense? No, that makes sense. Along with that, the security risks that it might bring up without training data.

2025-08-14 20:21:24
Is there anything you want us to stay away from, like the data specifically you want to stay away from, like imagery where there might be blood or anything that could be flagged as sensitive?

2025-08-14 20:21:30
So you're talking about where you source material that you're going to use for your training and so on.

2025-08-14 20:21:58
And I think that's an interesting question. I think I wouldn't be so worried about blood because it could be if you think of an investigation, since blood might be a useful. But quite obviously, I would think the university would be very unhappy with you if you did this and I wouldn't be very impressed. Violence, you know, children, anything to do with children that's inappropriate. Just think of anything that in society is considered to be.

2025-08-14 20:22:01
Inappropriate by normal Classic.

2025-08-14 20:22:07
Behavioural standards would absolutely be no go right, but I'm sure the university wouldn't be impressed if you.

2025-08-14 20:22:13
Brought any of those things into the project, but stick with real world scenarios.

2025-08-14 20:22:23
But obviously you can, and I've done analysis to test data with pictures of people breaking into cars or.

2025-08-14 20:22:42
You find this online but someone sticking up a shop with a an armed robbery picture of a someone robbing a shop that someones taken from a real CCTV camera? That's legitimate real world stuff as long as it's not depicting violence that would upset or impact people.

2025-08-14 20:23:01
Yeah, no, that makes that's clear. Yeah. Just wanted to confirm one our constraints for the data to be trained on. And so that just made me think of something we often we think about editing media to put people in or is often very.

2025-08-14 20:23:16
Core Focus particularly around deep fakes but think about putting in objects into pictures that could be taking a gun out, taking a car out you know taking an item out of the picture that was alleged was stolen so it could be objects and so.

2025-08-14 20:23:20
Video and image object detection.

2025-08-14 20:23:31
Analytics would be useful somewhere in your process, definitely. Perhaps there's objects in the in 10 frames before, and those objects are no longer there in the background.

2025-08-14 20:23:34
That's a good reason to think something's a bit strange, isn't it?

2025-08-14 20:23:36
Yeah.

2025-08-14 20:23:48
Hi, David. I just have a couple of quick questions. Firstly, thank you so much for hopping on late at night.

2025-08-14 20:23:50
One of the questions I had was.

2025-08-14 20:24:17
Regarding the API tokens, so obviously we will be dealing with a lot of processing, lot of tokenization and that would require a lot of firstly GPU for good models and then also API tokens for the embeddings. How open are you to providing that sort of infrastructure? So with the GPU, there's not much.

2025-08-14 20:24:21
Either of us can do, because to get good GPU is very expensive.

2025-08-14 20:24:27
But in terms of the API tokens, how open are you to providing those?

2025-08-14 20:24:37
Look, it wasn't something that we've ever thought about. I mean, my understanding was, and you maybe, I don't know, Steve, you can help the team.

2025-08-14 20:24:58
That there's, I understand that there's some free resources you're able to access in Google Collab and some of those environments where you can leverage those resources because I know other students have done projects with GPU intensive. So I'm hoping you've got the capacity through the university machine to access some of those.

2025-08-14 20:25:03
You probably have access more powerful stuff than I could even provide it if I did, but.

2025-08-14 20:25:11
Yeah, the GPU is fine, it's just the API tokens, particularly for the image embeddings.

2025-08-14 20:25:13
It's those that are of.

2025-08-14 20:25:18
Yeah.

2025-08-14 20:25:22
I mean, can you help them with that concept, Steve?

2025-08-14 20:25:27
I think.

2025-08-14 20:25:38
For the University of Melbourne, they don't provide any API or GPU resources, at least for this subject, so.

2025-08-14 20:25:54
I think it the only resource they have is those that are free online like Google collab and I don't know, maybe there's like in Microsoft something. But yeah, it's quite limited.

2025-08-14 20:26:03
Yeah, I guess. I'm sorry, I haven't. It hasn't been discussed with the university from my perspective.

2025-08-14 20:26:16
I mean, one suggestion is that you, if you're limited to performance capability, limit the limit the capability of the tool that you're developing to because bear in mind that the tool will need to be run offline.

2025-08-14 20:26:29
So the tool need to run in a closed laboratory with small small systems. It's not going to be run on using open AI or Mistral or infrastructure so.

2025-08-14 20:26:30
Don't shoot for the stars.

2025-08-14 20:26:50
Is it training of the model that's very GPU intensive and token intensive? Once the model is trained completely then it's like it's a black box and it doesn't take much computation power to actually run it through. It's just the training itself that's very expensive. What about using existing models?

2025-08-14 20:27:12
It's still because you still have to train them. It is still GPU intensive. My concern is not with the GPU. I think that should be fine. Like we can leave it running on for like a week straight and I think that should be fine. But it's more about the API tokens, so particularly with image embeddings.

2025-08-14 20:27:22
Some, particularly if you're building like a multimodal sort of a network or if you're building like a three dimensional transformer for videos.

2025-08-14 20:27:27
Using open source and existing frameworks to encode the image and videos.

2025-08-14 20:27:42
Do not result in the best sort of encodings that you can have. As a result, the model does not really perform. It doesn't really go anywhere because the data is not being captured effectively so.

2025-08-14 20:28:08
Is if we do show you a sort of a good working model that that's sort of performing reasonably well, would you be open to just for a sort of a limited size of data providing API tokens so we can run it, run it through like run it through a model and see if it's performing with the better tokens, Is the model performing better? And what would be?

2025-08-14 20:28:10
The cost of doing that?

2025-08-14 20:28:32
Yeah, that's not something I don't exactly know. I can't code a figure. It's just it depends a lot on the data, what we're processing, what type of, how large is it and that kind of a thing if you haven't really decided how much, like we have to decide the train test split and everything. So it's not really something.

2025-08-14 20:28:46
You've encountered, but obviously because of the recent competition powers, the API tokens are usually cheaper now. Like much cheaper than they were before like 2 years ago. Let's talk about it. If you come up with a strategy and you can demonstrate.

2025-08-14 20:28:48
You know what the value of doing is? Let's talk about.

2025-08-14 20:29:17
OK. The only thing I'd ask you to also consider is there's many, many models out there that have been trained to do video and object detection. There's new models that have come out in the last six months or 12 months that are very, very, this is open source stuff. And I've had a number of projects over the last year with some masters students around LL using LL Mississippi to do some forensic analytics and we've used a lot of models, but.

2025-08-14 20:29:24
So consider that, and if you want to have a discussion with me about why you don't think that works or why you think it would be much more successful to try something else.

2025-08-14 20:29:26
Let's talk about it.

2025-08-14 20:29:51
But don't let it sort of hinder your project to being sort of pointless, if you know what I mean. Yeah, just one small request. I think the slides that the sort of the project brief that you shared with Steve, I think it was just the project brief. I was hoping you could set share the slides as well that you showed during the tutorial. I think that would be great as well. But there's nothing else in this slide. It's not in that document.

2025-08-14 20:29:53
So what we're wanting off the?

2025-08-14 20:30:15
I was looking for the slides, like the slides that you used for presenting during the class. I think it would be more beneficial for us, particularly for writing up the reports and during team meetings to have that. I think what I was saying is that PDF that was I sent to you.

2025-08-14 20:30:23
Is exactly the same words off the slides, so I don't, and I haven't given that to the other group of five, five student groups.

2025-08-14 20:30:28
There's no difference between the slides and the text, just pictures on the inner PowerPoint format.

2025-08-14 20:30:29
OK.

2025-08-14 20:30:34
So every word that's on the slides is in that PDF that you were given.

2025-08-14 20:30:35
OK.

2025-08-14 20:31:00
Hi, David. Thank you for meeting us today. Just one question to confirm like do you have any like preferred format for the final report or the weekly report? Like how can we display the process to you? Do you have any like the weekly report as opposed to output from the tool?

2025-08-14 20:31:04
Just status updates are you talking about? Yes.

2025-08-14 20:31:33
Do you, I've used previous with previous students, I've used JIRA and Confluence. Do you guys use that? Yes. We already set up so you could just invite me to join the group and then you could put all your material and project material in there and status updates. And if we have a status update calls, we can go through those documents. Happy to do that. Oh yeah. Cool.

2025-08-14 20:31:34
Can I please have your email?

2025-08-14 20:31:38
Have you they got anything? It should be on the meeting.

2025-08-14 20:31:42
OK, yeah, meeting email.

2025-08-14 20:31:46
Thank you, if you need anything else just send me an email or.

2025-08-14 20:31:51
Are you using? Are you using Slack as a group?

2025-08-14 20:31:57
So you can again, I've joined the select groups with project teams, so you can invite me to join and.

2025-08-14 20:32:01
And then you can chat to me about stuff, particularly you as the team leaders, if you've got things you want to.

2025-08-14 20:32:07
Ask during the week or during the. Feel free to do that. Thank you.

2025-08-14 20:32:22
I want to add a question, David. So basically I see that you are expecting.

2025-08-14 20:32:45
A these two to detect the deep fake images. But I like. My question is how much do you want to focus on the novelty? Like proposing a new solution, like using the state of art model to build something that actually works better than what we have already?

2025-08-14 20:33:07
Or more towards a structure so that we are using current for example pre trained model to do something but we have a structure to so that it can be replaced later on. Yes the second definitely seeking some state of the art I mean I.

2025-08-14 20:33:12
In discussing it with Professor Sterling and Chris.

2025-08-14 20:33:14
I was.

2025-08-14 20:33:25
Reminded that you guys know you're doing your core degree, you're not master students doing focus research. I just it was just an opportunity to give you an interesting project.

2025-08-14 20:33:39
For you, that's a hot topic, and I think the value would be in all of the different teams creating a tool that can do things that are readily available in their own right, but not as an embedded tool.

2025-08-14 20:33:50
So yeah, it's creating a tool environment that can be enhanced or as you said, models can be changed, algorithms can be added in or out.

2025-08-14 20:34:00
Yeah, don't. I don't want to put too much pressure on everybody, but if you've got groups that really want to go hard and do some stupid creative stuff, well, I don't want to discourage that.

2025-08-14 20:34:10
I'm trying to be fair and reasonable know it's a 11 semester subject team of five. I hope you have some fun and we get some interesting results.

2025-08-14 20:34:16
Yep, that's one thing, I think.

2025-08-14 20:34:23
Yep, just looking forward to all the solutions they have.

2025-08-14 20:34:36
One other thing like it's more logistic because for this week we only have Thursday night as like available slot. So do you prefer like for example in the following weeks to have weekly meeting at different time or?

2025-08-14 20:34:51
Yeah, I mean, what do people think about doing it at this time? Is it OK or is it not good to do it this time of the day? What would you prefer? I'm OK with it. Yeah, I'm fine. It's all good with me. Yeah, I'm fine with it as well. Yeah, I'm happy to do that.

2025-08-14 20:35:02
We open to act nice stuff and then we can just have a chat. So and So what we do, we just do it like this every week or we can cancel it if for some reason that there's a semester break or.

2025-08-14 20:35:11
Yeah, I think there's a semester break later on, but I will manage this everybody. Yeah, sure.

2025-08-14 20:35:14
I look forward to it.

2025-08-14 20:35:21
And hopefully it will be interesting for you as team leaders to hear the other teams questions and things that might provoke some ideas and.

2025-08-14 20:35:30
Identify some problems that we've all we all see. Yeah. So look forward to it. Thank you, guys.

2025-08-14 20:35:38
Thank you. Sorry, I just have one more question if that's OK. Yeah, of course, just.

2025-08-14 20:36:00
I I'm sorry, I can't really pronounce your name. Dhruv brought up a really good point on the idea of API tokens. So just on that, I worked previously at a company where we use generative AI and we had this issue with tokens as well. And so they had to perform some sort of like soft launch on the smaller data set.

2025-08-14 20:36:04
Can we take the same approach and maybe my question?

2025-08-14 20:36:16
Two questions. And one, how willing would you be to fund some sort of soft launch approach where we take a smaller data set size, prove it works on the smaller data set and that it could be scaled up?

2025-08-14 20:36:22
And the second question is what would that budget look like if a budget?

2025-08-14 20:36:29
I'll answer the second question first. I really need you to come back to me and tell me what you think the cost would look like.

2025-08-14 20:36:36
So as I said, I'm happy to talk to you about it, but I'm wondering whether.

2025-08-14 20:36:38
Whether states point that?

2025-08-14 20:36:48
This is not about trying to develop some state new capability. You can just use existing algorithms existing.

2025-08-14 20:36:55
Tools, code technologies and just embed them in your tool. So.

2025-08-14 20:36:57
Just think about.

2025-08-14 20:37:01
What's the benefit of doing that? I mean, I'm really interested if you think you.

2025-08-14 20:37:05
You can come up with something by training some data. I'm interested to see it but.

2025-08-14 20:37:08
Is there a reason? What? What's the?

2025-08-14 20:37:39
Is it because you two groups are thinking about heading in a path that needs AAPI token resource or resources to it? What about all the other groups? Does that mean everybody needs it? Or are you heading in a path that's taking a slight different approach? So just on my experience with AI in general, it usually uses like tokens to think. And if I'm going to be using an existing tool, usually they're going to be paid and they're required. So for example, with open a IS API, they're going to require you to pay for.

2025-08-14 20:37:42
The token usage and.

2025-08-14 20:38:00
There are tools out there that allow you to install 'cause I know you mentioned that you wanted the tool to work offline that allow you to install models locally. I'm not too sure how feasible it is to put an entire sort of LLM or model onto a single machine.

2025-08-14 20:38:06
Maybe I'm missing like a point? Maybe there's something that I.

2025-08-14 20:38:11
I haven't seen it. You've hit an important point, so.

2025-08-14 20:38:17
Maybe there's a round in circles that we need to do together.

2025-08-14 20:38:25
For the last 18 months I've been working with groups of students and on open source offline LLM.

2025-08-14 20:38:30
Capabilities to do forensic analysis of data non.

2025-08-14 20:38:43
Largely non image data and definitely non video data. We've been doing log files, we're doing, you know, text files, we've been doing voice, so we're doing audio and we've done some image.

2025-08-14 20:38:50
So you absolutely can do it, but of course you can't scale to open AIS capability all of the large scale.

2025-08-14 20:39:01
But the reason why that doesn't bother me at all is because a forensic lab would never use Open AI or Google.

2025-08-14 20:39:04
The larger scale one.

2025-08-14 20:39:11
X Grok would never use their systems to analyse confidential private evidence.

2025-08-14 20:39:19
So we have this restriction in the forensic industry. It's got to be an offline environment, so the scale can never.

2025-08-14 20:39:25
Never use those big systems, so we may be talking about.

2025-08-14 20:39:27
As you say, a step.

2025-08-14 20:39:34
A step away from the big systems and being restricted to doing offline local analytics.

2025-08-14 20:39:41
I guess sorry, is that maybe something that's been misunderstood that using?

2025-08-14 20:39:48
A large scale commercial vendor system would be useful, whereas it could never be used in the real world, so maybe it's not worth even using it for.

2025-08-14 20:39:53
For this, I do appreciate that some of you talked about training.

2025-08-14 20:40:01
And there's nothing wrong with training a model online for use offline, so I absolutely acknowledge that.

2025-08-14 20:40:11
But I guess for A1 semester project, group project, are you biting off more than you can handle it? I just mean by in the time make it hard for yourself.

2025-08-14 20:40:16
By wanting to go off and train a new model.

2025-08-14 20:40:23
As I said, I'd love you to do something and say, well this is what we come up with, but I don't want you to get yourself into a projectile.

2025-08-14 20:40:29
Where you could find the best open source models and run those? Is that worth thinking about?

2025-08-14 20:40:38
I guess in my case I just had a slight misunderstanding with the available resources, So what I plan on doing is I'll.

2025-08-14 20:41:08
Do some research and see what's available. Yep, but I'm assuming since you've mentioned that there are students in the past that have previously managed to work with open source tools for free and on their local machines. And obviously there's things out there that do exist, so I'm all too concerned. Yep, I was a supervisor like with Professor Sterling and Chris. Actually Chris Irwin with two masters students have just finished their 2 masters degrees on using LL Mississippi for.

2025-08-14 20:41:08
Forensic analysis.

2025-08-14 20:41:35
Just finished it in December and we have, we've got working prototypes, but it's not in the stuff you're doing, right. It's not in the space of deep fake synthetic media video analytics. So that's the reason for giving you guys the opportunity to have a go, but not with the complexity of trying to build this whole LLM. You don't need to use an LLM, but using some machine learning algorithms or absolutely you'll need to use some, but.

2025-08-14 20:41:43
In my slide in the document I've given you, I've given you hints about non AI analytics techniques.

2025-08-14 20:41:47
So you can do all sorts of analytics of them that have nothing to do with mill.

2025-08-14 20:41:51
But you won't. It won't be very successful if you don't use ML, right? Is that?

2025-08-14 20:41:59
Yeah, I just on that point you've just made, is it possible for you to?

2025-08-14 20:42:04
Provide the names of the previous master students if they're willing to, maybe.

2025-08-14 20:42:15
Talk about their experience with the project and if they ask them, yeah, I mean I'll ask them. We have regular catch ups. In fact, I think I'm talking to them early next week. So how about I talk to them about.

2025-08-14 20:42:28
About that, yeah, please. I'd appreciate it. Know, remember, they're no longer at university because I've graduated. But yeah, I just would like to ask questions if they're willing to. Yeah, of course. Yep. Thank you. You're welcome.

2025-08-14 20:42:34
And bring bring this up at the next meeting, right? Bring all these issues up at the next meeting we have so we'll.

2025-08-14 20:42:37
I think we're all just trying to orientate on what's the focus, Madam.

2025-08-14 20:42:45
Think of closed forensic labs. No one can get in there and no one can use the big, big AI machines.

2025-08-14 20:42:54
Yeah, and I think, sorry, that one last comment someone said before we can let it run for hours in my world, the forensic world.

2025-08-14 20:42:59
We don't love it, but we don't mind if we have to wait for hours to get a good result.

2025-08-14 20:43:15
It doesn't have to be instantaneous result. We just want someone asked it on the presentation the other day, is it about quality or quantity? It's about quality. We have to wait five hours for to analyse a video and it gives a good result that's worth it.

2025-08-14 20:43:17
If you do it faster, that's even better.

2025-08-14 20:43:33
So do you think that was the important, important issue about not going for state of the art and focusing on bringing together components? Is that sort of an important thing for the groups to capture?

2025-08-14 20:43:39
Sorry, was that a question? Yeah, just to Steve.

2025-08-14 20:43:49
Sorry, I said. Do you think it's important that all the groups appreciate the difference between trying to do something, state of the art?

2025-08-14 20:43:53
Exploring new capabilities as opposed to bringing components together.

2025-08-14 20:43:56
Into a workable application.

2025-08-14 20:44:17
I will say because for the state of art the university and doesn't have any resources provided, so it will be quite hard to especially in at this stage to give much of a good result.

2025-08-14 20:44:19
Of course.

2025-08-14 20:44:46
I think like for from Leon and Chris, what they have in mind is that if they want to try research, as long as you agree with them then it's fine. But I, I'm just about like concerned about the results like for research, there's always a chance of failing as like in contracts to the software component it's.

2025-08-14 20:44:51
More likely to just build a software, build a product for it. Yep.

2025-08-14 20:44:57
And then maybe I did mention earlier and maybe it's important that you.

2025-08-14 20:44:59
Each of your teams you think about.

2025-08-14 20:45:04
Doing individual images.

2025-08-14 20:45:06
Should be quite achievable.

2025-08-14 20:45:12
Doing some sort of analytics of individual images or a batch of a small batch of images.

2025-08-14 20:45:16
Doing small short videos that might be.

2025-08-14 20:45:21
2 minutes long. 3 minutes long that come from a CCTV camera.

2025-08-14 20:45:30
Should I think? I'm hoping should be achievable. Analysing an hour long video is probably infeasible, but I don't want to discourage you.

2025-08-14 20:45:34
But if that helps the team's focus.

2025-08-14 20:45:42
It's OK if it's all about short small batches to show how it works.

2025-08-14 20:46:10
They were just another very quick question. I was wondering about the back end system. So were you expecting a kind of a login system where different forensic analysts can log in to their account, see the sort of videos that they have or photos that they have sent for analysis? What were the results of those analysis? Do you want that kind of a system on the back end or do you want kind of like an?

2025-08-14 20:46:18
Like uploaded, get the results, download the file from the results and then it's just wipe from the memory like logged obviously at the back end but.

2025-08-14 20:46:43
That's the limited usage. It's a fair question I think something in between, so not a super multi user segmented back in database, but something that allows projects to be created. So there might be a project that's on, you know, doing some images and if you give a project name, you store the images in the vector database or wherever you're storing them in the file system.

2025-08-14 20:46:51
You might. You have another project where you're uploading a video, you give it a name and it's and it's this particular video. The results are stored.

2025-08-14 20:47:00
And then it can be deleted from the back end database. It can be retained in the back end database, so not a.

2025-08-14 20:47:28
Not a process and dump and not a highly structured multi user long term application data store, but the project task tracking and retaining it until till the user deletes it. So in that case you would probably need some user accounts that and David run some projects. He's got these three projects when you know Fred uses this project, he's over there and David.

2025-08-14 20:47:29
David's data is not mixed.

2025-08-14 20:47:50
I think the Co mingling of data is really important to separate because you don't want roles to be result to be contaminated by other commingled data. So if you if you're using a vector database or any database to store it, you have separate separate instances or separate separate data stores.

2025-08-14 20:48:20
Yes, just to absolutely clarify that point. So you want kind of an individual account based system where that you can run your own forensic analysis and you can sort of track the progress, see the results. And if someone else is running it, they have their own account, their own projects that they are running, they're seeing and on the one project they can submit multiple images, multiple videos, that kind of infrastructure, is that correct? Yes, Yep, just use a project.

2025-08-14 20:48:30
Separate content for each project in the sense of maybe task to analyse these images, analyse this video and then come back the next day and see them there, do some more.

2025-08-14 20:48:33
A bit like a workspace, got it.

2025-08-14 20:48:38
Thanks, but only simple enough to not make it complicated for you.

2025-08-14 20:48:41
Yeah, and to manage him.

2025-08-14 20:49:08
No worries. I've just got one thing to add. Like this is not really a question, but it's just thing I think I should tell from my experience is that if we were to generate something that generate a new model to detect video forensics, it is probably infeasible even if we have access to let's say 10 high end GPUs because of how.

2025-08-14 20:49:11
Media Video media is developing.

2025-08-14 20:49:28
Faster, whereas photographic media still media is already nearly fully developed near the ages of where you can't really tell a deep fake and a real photo just from looking at it first glance.

2025-08-14 20:49:37
Great. So I think the misconception there with other students where they were wondering with the tokenization.

2025-08-14 20:49:41
It's probably because if you were to run a media version of.

2025-08-14 20:50:06
So not the training model. The model is trained, we use a lot of processing power, but when running it locally in the black box to detect the video, it still might require more processing power, much more processing power than just detecting an image where it's just simple detection techniques where a video you might actually have to do reprocessing of the whole media.

2025-08-14 20:50:20
Yeah. And so your conclusion or your suggestion is, I'm just my suggestion is it's probably not the best idea to even try to make something.

2025-08-14 20:50:37
New generate a new video detection model because of our current restraints and even if you were able to create one with how fast it's developing and how fast I've been able to move my deep fakes from looking.

2025-08-14 20:50:47
Detectable to being somewhat reasonable. In the span of time, it's going to get even better and the model has to be retrained. It's just not as effective I feel.

2025-08-14 20:51:04
And I mean, I'll just add your point, so I acknowledge what you say is quite reasonable. I had never thought this project would result in people wanting to develop and train models, but I don't want to discourage people who think they can do that. But I but I'm.

2025-08-14 20:51:18
Not comfortable to support some costly exercise to just to train data, but if someone's got a good idea and they can convince me that it's worth a go, please try. But my understanding is that.

2025-08-14 20:51:24
Bouncing off what you're saying, there's lots and lots of models coming out every month. Every.

2025-08-14 20:51:30
Every short period of time that are doing more and more sophisticated object detection in videos.

2025-08-14 20:51:47
I can't remember off the top of my head but I sort of try and keep a track of watching them keep on growing and changing. Surely or surely I know there are quantized. There's super powerful ones you can't run on small GPU right? But there's quantized versions that run quite reasonably.

2025-08-14 20:51:50
And that's the ones that would work in a forensic lab.

2025-08-14 20:52:04
Yeah, 4 bit quantized or whatever. I just, it's just yeah, it's small, it's not powerful, it's not Elon Musk's, you know, model, but it'll work in a lab to analyse the three minute video, I hope.

2025-08-14 20:52:13
And as you said, Steve, maybe there's a student group that wants to push the boundaries and finds that.

2025-08-14 20:52:18
They've done all this stuff and it's not successful. I mean, maybe that's a maybe that's a good outcome anyway.

2025-08-14 20:52:24
But it might be a fun one for the project team if you in the end you can't do it but.

2025-08-14 20:52:28
I guess that's probably for you, Steve, to guide them rather than me.

2025-08-14 20:52:36
Yeah, 'cause in our perspective, 'cause we.

2025-08-14 20:52:52
As for this subject is basically marking people like how good they are in project management for example. So I will say is.

2025-08-14 20:53:02
Like there's five people in each team, so if you do want to explore more than.

2025-08-14 20:53:16
So just please first let me know and I will also discuss with the Chris and Leon to see if they will give some exemptions to this.

2025-08-14 20:53:18
But.

2025-08-14 20:53:37
Yeah. It's not for me to decide to change in the marketing criteria, but of course I, I'm optimistic on this. As long as I mean for them as us, you David is satisfied with the result, then I think it will be fine. Yeah, Yep.

2025-08-14 20:54:03
They're just very, very briefly. Obviously my groups very interested in this going sort of beyond the regular models. Obviously we're going to focus and prioritise building a stable working product first before we venture into any sort of exploration and before we ask for any investment financially, we're obviously going to look for.

2025-08-14 20:54:29
If we have a good working product existing, so, but it's just something that we're looking for from a research side of things. I personally think it's quite a doable thing because to my understanding of the deep fake models is that they sample from a space like they have a latent space and they sample data from a latent space. And if you can sort of build.

2025-08-14 20:54:38
Like a support vector machine, kind of a model to separate out the rear from their fake, then it is actually quite doable. So it's just something we're looking to do. But again, we're going to be very.

2025-08-14 20:54:48
You're going to only explore it if we have the time and resources permitting. Yeah, it sounds like an interesting sort of sense of direction.

2025-08-14 20:55:13
And I guess there's a few options. You can obviously you can retrain existing models that are already good, all sorts of shortcuts you can take. There's mixture of expert models that have a lot of capability, but they're trained down just to do a certain thing. And I think if what you're saying is if you were to focus on it just doing the task that I'm asking it to do rather than all of the video image analysis, maybe that's a good idea.

2025-08-14 20:55:14
Good luck.

2025-08-14 20:55:18
Get permission to make sure you get some marks.

2025-08-14 20:55:36
I like my stress room would be firstly just don't forget the software parts 'cause that's the one that I'm like Mark you based on and secondly is.

2025-08-14 20:56:05
For the resources, I think you are mostly limited to what you have and the free resources. And I think at this stage it will require really brilliant idea to make something in the machine learning world to work. Because like you talk about supporting vector machine and I think it requires the data to be linear separable but.

2025-08-14 20:56:06
It might not be the case.

2025-08-14 20:56:09
So.

2025-08-14 20:56:38
I want to say I would like to see how the result is, but just keep that in mind. Actually, just one last comment for me, which has come from a bit of a recent discussion and what you just said then Steve, is it don't forget the application. You do something cool in the interface, you process some data and you show heat maps and pictures and it marking areas where there's possible editing so that the user is actually getting the ability to.

2025-08-14 20:56:42
Understand things that they personally don't technically couldn't technically do.

2025-08-14 20:56:44
So you might be able to just.

2025-08-14 20:56:49
Make a full feature. Very very helpful tool.

2025-08-14 20:56:53
Rather than doing some super duper thing in the back end. But.

2025-08-14 20:56:55
Looking forward to what you all.

2025-08-14 20:56:57
Create.

2025-08-14 20:57:00
And look forward to talking to you each week.

2025-08-14 20:57:02
Thank you.

2025-08-14 20:57:05
Thank you, David. You're welcome.

2025-08-14 20:57:10
Thank you, David. Thank you.

2025-08-14 20:57:14
Bye.
