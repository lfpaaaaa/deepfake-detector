  - All test documentation updated with new paths

### Migration Notes
- ⚠️ **For Existing Users**: Manual installations need to reorganize model files:
  ```bash
  # Create models directory
  mkdir -p models
  
  # Move TruFor weights
  mv trufor.pth.tar models/
  
  # Move DeepfakeBench
  mv vendors models/
  ```
- ✅ **Docker Users**: Simply rebuild the image with `docker compose up -d --build`
