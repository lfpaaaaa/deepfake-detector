## 1. Test Cycle Overview

### 1.1 Objectives (Fast Track - Core Tests Only)
- ✅ Verify DeepfakeBench video analysis works
- ✅ Test file upload error handling (invalid files)
- ✅ Test large file upload handling
- ✅ Verify user registration validation
- ✅ Verify detection results stored in history
- ✅ Test report generation (PDF/ZIP)

**Note**: This is a **fast-track testing cycle** (2-3 hours) focusing on core functionality only. Comprehensive testing deferred to future cycles.

### 1.2 Scope (Fast Track)

#### In Scope (Core Tests Only - 6 tests):
1. ✅ Video analysis with DeepfakeBench (1 model test)
2. ✅ Invalid file format rejection
3. ✅ Large file upload handling
4. ✅ Duplicate username validation
5. ✅ History record verification
6. ✅ Report generation (PDF/ZIP)

#### Out of Scope (Deferred):
- ❌ TruFor image detection (skipped due to browser crash bug)
- ❌ Multiple model comparison
- ❌ Different image/video formats
- ❌ Performance benchmarking
- ❌ Concurrent requests testing
- ❌ Security testing (XSS, injection)
- ❌ Cross-browser compatibility
- ❌ API endpoint verification (endpoint not available)

### 1.3 Entry Criteria

**Prerequisites**:
- ✅ Cycle 1 completed with 100% pass rate
- ⚠️ Model weights downloaded and placed correctly:
  - `trufor.pth.tar` in project root
  - `vendors/DeepfakeBench/training/weights/*.pth` present
- ⚠️ Test data prepared (sample images and videos)
- ✅ Docker environment working
- ✅ All Cycle 1 bugs fixed

### 1.4 Exit Criteria

- ✅ All high-priority test cases pass (≥90%)
- ✅ At least one successful TruFor detection
- ✅ At least one successful DeepfakeBench video analysis
- ✅ File upload works for valid formats
- ✅ Invalid files are rejected gracefully
- ✅ Detection results saved to history
- ✅ Code coverage ≥ 60% (including new code)

## 2. Test Environment

**Local Testing Environment**:
- **OS**: Windows 10/11
- **Docker**: Docker Desktop with model weights
- **Python**: 3.11
- **Test Framework**: pytest + manual testing
- **Model Weights**: TruFor (~249MB) + DeepfakeBench (~780MB)

**CI Testing Environment**:
- **Note**: CI tests will skip model inference tests (too large for CI)
- **Focus**: Unit tests for model loading logic only
- **Mock**: Use mock objects for actual inference

## 4. Test Execution Strategy (Fast Track - Same Day)

### 4.1 Execution Timeline (2 Hours Total)

**18:00 - 18:30** (30 min) - Test 1: Video Analysis
- Upload test video (5-10s MP4)
- Select Xception model
- Measure analysis time
- Verify results displayed

**18:30 - 18:40** (10 min) - Test 2: Invalid File Upload
- Try uploading TXT file
- Verify rejection message
- Test with other invalid formats

**18:40 - 18:55** (15 min) - Test 3: Large File Upload
- Upload large video (>20MB)
- Check size limit handling
- Measure processing time if accepted

**18:55 - 19:00** (5 min) - Test 4: Duplicate Username
- Attempt duplicate registration
- Verify error handling

**19:00 - 19:10** (10 min) - Test 5: History Verification
- Check all detection records
- Verify data persistence
- Check filtering/sorting

**19:10 - 19:30** (20 min) - Test 6: Report Generation
- Generate PDF report
- Download ZIP package
- Verify file contents

**19:30 - 20:00** (30 min) - Documentation
- Update test report with results
- Organize screenshots
- Write summary

---

### 4.2 Testing Approach

**Single Pass Testing**:
- Execute each test once
- Record immediate results
- Move to next test quickly
- Document issues as found

**No Retries** (unless critical failure):
- If test fails, document and move on
- Focus on coverage, not perfection
- Time-boxed execution

**Evidence Collection**:
- Screenshot key results
- Copy-paste error messages
- Note timestamps

## 6. Risks and Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Model weights too large for Git | High | High | Use .gitignore, document download process |
| Model loading fails in Docker | High | Medium | Test locally first, check Docker logs |
| Detection takes too long | Medium | Medium | Set reasonable timeouts, optimize if needed |
| Out of memory errors | High | Low | Monitor Docker memory, increase if needed |
| CI cannot test with models | Medium | High | Use mocked tests in CI, real tests locally |

- ✅ At least 1 successful DeepfakeBench video analysis
- ✅ Invalid files rejected with clear errors
- ✅ System handles large files gracefully

- Critical Bugs: ≤ 2
- Documented: All tests recorded in report

**Acceptable Outcomes**:
- Some tests may fail due to known bugs (BUG-007)
- Focus on coverage, not perfection
- Document issues for future fixes

- **Model Weights**: Already available (Docker running)
- **Known Issues**: TruFor image detection crashes browser (BUG-007)
- **API Limitations**: `/api/models/status` endpoint not available (BUG-008)
- **Manual Testing**: 100% manual testing, no automation
- **Time Constraint**: Single-pass testing, minimal retries
- **Evidence**: Screenshots and basic metrics only

**Deferred to Future Cycles**:
- Comprehensive model testing
- Performance benchmarking
- Multiple format testing
- Security testing
- Cross-browser testing
