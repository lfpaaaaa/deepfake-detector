- "NaN%" displayed to user (confusing)
- Should show error: "File is empty or invalid"
- Wastes processing time

**Comparison with TC-E-107**:
- Identical behavior to corrupted file test
- Same root cause: Lack of pre-processing file validation
- Both need client-side validation

**Recommendation**:
- Add file size validation: minimum 1KB
- Check file is not empty before upload
- Show clear error message for empty files
- Reject 0-byte files immediately

**Related to**: BUG-009 (Invalid file handling)

**Time**: ~5 min  
**Date**: October 26, 2025 17:35

#### **TC-U-004: Token Expiration/Invalid Token Handling** ❌ FAIL (5 min)
**Test invalid token handling and redirect behavior**:

**Steps**:
1. ✅ Login successfully with valid credentials
2. ✅ Navigate to History page
3. ✅ Set token to invalid value: `invalid_token_12345`
4. ✅ Reload the page

**Expected Result**:
- ❌ Should detect invalid token
- ❌ Should redirect to login page
- ❌ Should show authentication error

**Actual Result**:
- ⚠️ Page reloaded but stayed on History page
- ⚠️ No redirect to login occurred
- ⚠️ No authentication error shown
- ⚠️ UI still displays (possibly cached HTML)

**Result**: [x] **FAIL** ❌

**🐛 BUG-010 Identified**: Invalid Token Not Redirecting to Login
- **Severity**: Medium-High 🔴
- **Type**: Security / Authentication
- **Impact**: Users with invalid tokens can still access protected page HTML (though API calls may fail)
- **Root Cause**: Frontend lacks token validation on page load
- **Recommendation**: Add token validation in `app/web/js/app.js` for all protected pages

**Time**: 5 min  
**Date**: October 26, 2025 19:35

---

#### **TC-A-008: Password Strength Validation** ⚠️ PARTIAL PASS (5 min)
**Test different password strengths during registration**:

| Password | Length | Expected | Actual | Result |
|----------|--------|----------|--------|--------|
| `123` | 3 chars | Reject (too short) | ❌ **Rejected** (requires ≥6 chars) | ✅ Pass |
| `password` | 8 chars | Reject (weak) | ✅ **Accepted** | ⚠️ Weak password allowed |
| `Test123!@#` | 11 chars | Accept (strong) | ✅ **Accepted** | ✅ Pass |

**Result**: [x] **Partial Pass** ⚠️

**Analysis**:
- ✅ **Minimum length validation**: System enforces ≥6 characters
- ✅ **Clear error message**: User informed when password too short
- ⚠️ **No complexity requirements**: Accepts pure lowercase letters (`password`)
- ⚠️ **Weak password allowed**: Common passwords like `password` not blocked
- ✅ **Strong passwords accepted**: Complex passwords work fine

**Security Assessment**:
- **Current**: Basic length check only (≥6 characters)
- **Missing**: 
  - No requirement for uppercase letters
  - No requirement for numbers
  - No requirement for special characters
  - No common password blacklist

**Recommendation**: 
- Add password complexity requirements (e.g., must contain uppercase, lowercase, number)
- Implement common password blacklist (e.g., reject "password", "123456", etc.)
- Consider password strength indicator in UI

**Time**: 5 min  
**Date**: October 26, 2025 20:15

**Notes**: System has basic password security (length check) which is acceptable for MVP, but production systems should enforce stronger password policies

---

#### **TC-A-009: Multiple Login Sessions** ✅ PASS (5 min)
**Test concurrent sessions and logout behavior**:

**Steps**:
1. ✅ **Browser Window 1**: Login with account `111` → Success
2. ✅ **Browser Window 2** (Incognito): Login with same account `111` → Success
3. ✅ **Both sessions active**: Both windows can access main page and perform operations
4. ✅ **Logout in Window 1**: Clicked logout button
5. ✅ **Check Window 2**: Attempted to use application

**Results**:
- ✅ **Multi-session login**: **Supported** - Same account can login on multiple browsers simultaneously
- ✅ **Both sessions functional**: Both windows could access protected pages
- ✅ **Logout revokes all sessions**: Window 1 logout → Window 2 also logged out
- ✅ **Window 2 behavior**: Shows "You are not logged in. Redirecting to login page." alert

**Result**: [x] **Pass** ✅

**Analysis**:
- ✅ **Excellent security design**: Logout properly revokes ALL tokens for that user
- ✅ **Token revocation mechanism**: Likely using `data/sessions/revoked_tokens.json`
- ✅ **Global session invalidation**: All devices/browsers logged out simultaneously
- ✅ **Proper authentication check**: System detects revoked token and redirects to login

**Security Assessment**:
- **Behavior**: Logout terminates all active sessions globally
- **Benefit**: Prevents unauthorized access if user logs out (e.g., security concern)
- **Use case**: Ideal for forensic/security applications where session control is critical
- **Alternative**: Some systems allow per-device logout, but global logout is more secure

**Evidence**: Alert message "You are not logged in. Redirecting to login page." displayed in Window 2 after Window 1 logout

**Time**: 5 min  
**Date**: October 26, 2025 20:20

**Notes**: This is best-practice security behavior for a deepfake detection system. Token revocation ensures that logout is truly effective across all sessions.

**Test sorting functionality in History table**:

**Steps**:
1. ✅ Navigate to History page with multiple records
2. ✅ Observe default sort order
3. ✅ Attempt to click column headers (Filename, Date, Score, etc.)
4. ✅ Check for sort indicators (arrows ↑↓)

**Results**:
- ✅ **Records displayed**: Multiple records visible in table
- ✅ **Default order**: Fixed order (by record creation/ID)
- ❌ **Column header clicks**: Not clickable - no interactive sorting
- ❌ **Sort direction toggle**: Not available
- ❌ **Sort indicators**: No arrows or visual indicators

**Current Sorting Behavior**:
- Records appear in fixed order (likely by database ID or creation time)
- Date column shows: 04:49 → 04:39 → 04:36 → 05:50 → 05:39 (not chronologically sorted)
- No user control over sort order

**Result**: [x] **Partial Pass** ⚠️

**🔧 UX Enhancement Opportunity**: No Interactive Sorting
- **Severity**: Low (UX Enhancement) 🟡
- **Type**: User Experience / Feature Gap
- **Impact**: Users cannot sort records by Date, Score, Filename, etc. for easier analysis
- **Current**: Fixed sort order only
- **Recommendation**: Add clickable column headers with ascending/descending sort
- **Common pattern**: Click Date → newest first → click again → oldest first
- **Benefit**: Improves usability for users analyzing many records

**Time**: 3 min  
**Date**: October 26, 2025 20:00

**Notes**: System functions correctly but lacks sorting convenience. This is acceptable for MVP but should be considered for future enhancement. Users with many records would benefit from sorting by date, score, or filename.

**🐛 Additional Bug Discovered During This Test**: 

#### **BUG-011: F12 DevTools Causes Actions Column Layout Corruption**
- **Severity**: Medium 🟡
- **Type**: UI/CSS Responsive Design Bug
- **Discovered**: While testing History sorting functionality
- **Issue**: Opening browser DevTools (F12) triggers responsive layout change in Actions column (PDF/ZIP/Delete buttons), but closing F12 does NOT restore original layout
- **Impact**: Users who open DevTools will see corrupted UI that persists until page refresh
- **Expected**: Layout should dynamically adjust when window resizes (F12 opens/closes)
- **Actual**: Layout breaks and doesn't recover without page refresh
- **Root Cause**: CSS media queries or JavaScript layout logic not responding to window resize events correctly
- **Workaround**: Refresh page to restore normal layout
- **Recommendation**: Add window resize event listener to recalculate layout, or fix CSS responsive breakpoints
